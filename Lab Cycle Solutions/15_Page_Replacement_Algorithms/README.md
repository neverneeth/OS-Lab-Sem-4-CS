# AIM
Simulate the FIFO, LRU, and optimal page-replacement algorithms as follows: First,
generate a random page-reference string where page numbers range from 0 to 9. Apply the
random page-reference string to each algorithm, and record the number of page faults
incurred by each algorithm. Assume that demand paging is used. The length of the
reference string and the number of page frames (varying from 1 to 7) are to be received as
command line arguments. 

# ALGORITHM

**Step 1:** Start the program.

**Step 2:** Check if exactly two command-line arguments are provided (the length of the reference string and the number of frames). If not, print usage instructions and terminate the program.

**Step 3:** Convert the command-line arguments from text strings into integer values for the reference length and the frame count.

**Step 4:** Validate the converted inputs to ensure the number of frames is between 1 and 7, and the reference length is a valid positive number within the allowed maximum limit. If invalid, print an error message and terminate the program.

**Step 5:** Initialize a random number generator using the current system time to ensure the sequence of numbers is truly random.

**Step 6:** Generate a random sequence of page numbers (ranging from 0 to 9) based on the specified reference length, store them in a sequence array, and print the entire sequence to the console.

**Step 7:** Begin the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) page replacement simulation. 

**Step 8:** For the FIFO simulation, iterate through the generated reference sequence. For each page, check if it is already loaded in the frames. If it is not, replace the oldest loaded page (using a looping index), increment the FIFO page fault counter, and update the index.

**Step 9:** Begin the Least Recently Used (LRU) page replacement simulation. 

**Step 10:** For the LRU simulation, iterate through the reference sequence while tracking the last usage time of each frame. If a page is not in the frames, find the frame that has not been used for the longest period, replace it with the current page, update its usage time, and increment the LRU page fault counter.

**Step 11:** Begin the Optimal page replacement simulation. 

**Step 12:** For the Optimal simulation, iterate through the reference sequence. If a page is not in the frames, look ahead into the remaining unread sequence to find which currently loaded page will not be needed for the longest time in the future. Replace that specific page, load the current page, and increment the Optimal page fault counter.

**Step 13:** Print the total number of frames utilized for the simulation.

**Step 14:** Print the total number of page faults generated by the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) algorithm.

**Step 15:** Print the total number of page faults generated by the Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm.

**Step 16:** Print the total number of page faults generated by the Optimal algorithm.

**Step 17:** Stop.
