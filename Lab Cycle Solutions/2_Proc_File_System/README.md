Use /proc file system to gather basic information about your machine:
	(a) Number of CPU cores
	(b) Total memory and the fraction of free memory
	(c) Number of processes currently running.
	(d) Number of processes in the running and blocked states.
	(e) Number of processes forked since the last bootup. How do you compare
            this value with the one in (c) above?
	(f) The number of context switches performed since the last bootup for a
	    particular process.
